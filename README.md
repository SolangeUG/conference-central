This project is part of the [Udacity's Developping Scalabale Apps in Java][4] course, and deals with challenges of building applications that can serve hundreds of thousands of users, and how we can deal with them as software engineers.

More importantly, it shows how to harness the power of [App Engine][5] - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so that one can focus on their application's features, and not on managing infrastructure that runs the application.

To use Google App Engine, it's necessary to learn how it works, and this projects provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to do just that. It showcases the best practices of using [Cloud Endpoints][6] that allow to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and JavaScript clients. They allow to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.
